Equations of Motion in Python3
===========================================

This notebook reads in [DAVE-ML](https://daveml.org/) models, initial conditions
and then runs a simulation based on the equations of motion.  The results of 
the simulation are then compared to 
[NESC check cases](https://nescacademy.nasa.gov/flightsim/)

To use the this module, you will need:
1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
2. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
